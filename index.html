                <p>Profile
                    I am an energetic university student. Also, ambitious person who works hard and developed a mature
                    and responsible approach to any task that I undertake. I am excellent in working with others.
                    Further down my path i found a keen interest in IT where I have then achieved the chance to decide
                    my life to go on and follow my passion for IT. Where I have done a 3-year course in an Extended
                    Diploma in IT at South Gloucester and Stroud College
                    where I then became a class representative for my college year for all 2 years running.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>Work Experience
        I have also completed a week work experience program held by my college to hand-pick the best student to
        take to
        a great opportunity to be at ISG the which is one of Bristol’s most dynamic construction services
        company,
        delivering places that help people and businesses thrive. And I had the chance to soak in all important
        information on how the real-world function and tips for what I want to do in the future. Where this
        opportunity
        helped me develop my teamworking skills, tactical thinking skills, Good Communication Skills, and the
        ability to
        work well under pressure. I also worked as a mail sorter for Royal Mail in Filton, Bristol December
        2016-
        February 2017 My responsibilities included: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Successfully met targets. </li>
        <li>Sorting letters. </li>
        <li>Packing mail</li>
        <li>Moving mail using large trolleys.</li>
        <li>Working as part of a team. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
    <p>For my volunteering i have an interest in a weekly charity that I do where I volunteer my help to
        children that
        need a bike to go to school with. By fixing and teaching them how to maintain a bike they can later be
        independent and is a great skill for the future. This takes place every Friday where I usually support
        and help
        the children in the workshop. </p>
